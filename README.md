# Healthy Lifestyle Dashboard

Initial scaffold for the project. Pages: index, exercise, nutrition, habit, progress.

Open `index.html` in a static server (or live server) to preview.

Next steps:
- Implement ExerciseDB and Nutrition API integration
- Add charts with Chart.js or Recharts
- Improve responsive styles and accessibility
```

---

If you'd like, I can now:

* generate these files in the project folder for download,
* add Chart.js templates to `progress.html`,
* implement a sample ExerciseDB API call in `js/exercise.js`, or
* improve responsive styles and accessibility.

Which next step would you like?
